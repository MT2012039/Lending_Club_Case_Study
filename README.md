# Lending_Club_Case_Study
Case study of Lending club for Upgrad course

# Steps involved in the case study

1) Cleaning of the data set<br />
2) Analyse the cleaned dataset using Univariate Analysis and get Key insights into the independent variables<br />
3) Analyse the cleaned dataset using Bivaritae analysis and find the key relations and insight from 2 variables<br />
4) Added correlation matrix for numerical variables and analysed the key relations among multiple variables using heatmap<br />

# Cleaning data set

1)Removed all columns which has more than 50% missing data<br />
2)Removed all columns which has Null or Single unique values<br />
3)Removed all Null values by taking informed decision for each columns<br />
4)Converted date fields to datetime<br />
5)Converted rate fields (with %) to integer<br />
6)Converted few categorical columns like emp_length with custom values for analysis<br />
7)Created derived columns year and month from payment dates for segmented analysis<br />

# Univariate Analysis

1)Analysis of quantitative variables using boxplot.Cleaning of outliers in few cases (like annual income and interest rates)<br />
2)Univariate analysis of unordered categorical variables using histogram and bar plots<br />
3)Univariate analysis of ordered categorical variables using hist plot<br />
4)Segmented analysis<br />

# Bivariate analysis

1)Analysis of Loan status based on different categorical variables<br />
2)Use of graphical representations like histplot,barplot,boxplots for clarity in analysis<br />
3)Getting essential insights into the data and relation from the data using the analysis<br />
4)Generating the corelation plot on all numerical variables<br />
5)Finding essential insights into the correlation of multiple variables using heatmap <br />
