## General Information
- Lending Club case study for Upgrad course on AI and analytics.
- A real world scenario where a consumer finance company that specialises in lending various types of loans to its urban customers has to analyse various factors and make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
- An inadequate analysis backed with data can lead to either loss of customer or a loss of money to the company. 
- A Loan dataset has been used for the purpose of analysis It contains the complete loan data of the company for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a data analysis technique that is used  to analyze the data set and provide with meaningful business oriented insights.

## Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook 6.5.4
- Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/)
- pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)


## Conclusions
- Loan amount higher than 30K at an interest rate equal or above 15% is a high risk account and hence must be thoroughly investigated before taking a decision.
- For a loan amount of more than 30K, an annual income of the borrower must be equal of greater than 70K.
- To avoid defaults, the debt to income ratio of the borrower must be less than 30
- Home ownership must be checked and verified. Mortgage and rent is one of the risk factor.
- Loans falling under grades E,F,G are seen to have a high risk associated. For grade G, people with annual income less than equal to 70K and interest rate more than 20% tend to default. Hence at high risk. 
- An employment length is 10+ yrs and loan amount of 12k-14k is a high risk account.
- A loan amount of more than 15K taken for a purpose of small business is at high risk.
- Borrower having more than 1 public recorded bankruptcies and delinq count is at high risk.
- Borrower having a high amount of outstanding balance in his revolving accounts is at a high risk.
